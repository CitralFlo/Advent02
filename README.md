# Advent of Code - Day 2

This is a Java program that reads an input file containing pairs of "rock paper scissors" moves, and then scores them based on the rules of the game. The program outputs the total points for each player in the console logs.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you will need Java installed on your computer. 

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Start the program by running the main file.
4. The program will read the input file named "input.txt" in the project directory and output the total points in the console logs.

## Scoring Rules

The scoring rules are as follows:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

Points are awarded for outcome of matches and for choosing correct tools by first player. The program sums the total of points and gives the answer in console logs.
